# Client Database

This is a Rails 5 application implementing a rudimentary Client database application.
Created to teach myself Ruby on Rails

The application is implemented using these components:

* Ruby version 2.5.1
* Rails version 5.2.0
* AdminLTE version 2 (latest version)
* PostgreSQL version 9.5.13
* SweetAlert2 

## Configuration
The initial database can be created with 
```
rake db:setup
```
This will create the database tables and populate the tables with some sample data.

This description will be updated as the project continues.
